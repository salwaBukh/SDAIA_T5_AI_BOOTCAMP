# Capstone

This repository contains a collection of deep learning models designed to address critical challenges faced by coffee farmers. The models are tailored to solve specific problems in coffee farming, including coffee leaf diseases detection, pests detection, coffee fruit maturity assessment, and coffee bean roast optimization.

## Project Overview

### Coffee Leaf Diseases Classifier:
- Utilizes deep learning algorithms to identify and diagnose various diseases affecting coffee leaves at an early stage.

### Pests Detection:
- Implements advanced image processing techniques to detect and classify pests that may threaten coffee crops.

### Coffee Fruit Maturity Assessment:
- Employs machine learning models to assess the maturity of coffee fruits, aiding in optimal harvest timing.

### Coffee Bean Roast Optimization:
- Leverages deep learning to provide precise guidance for achieving the ideal coffee bean roast, enhancing flavor and quality.
